# IPSA-email
This is the location of HTML email Templates for the IPSA Organization
The purpose of this repository is to contain and track updates to email templates
that I have created for the IPSA(International Programs Student Ambassadors).
These are used in conjunction with mailchimp in order to autofill necessary information for mass emailing prospective students.
